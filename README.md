# compiler_for_hml

Compiler for HML which uses all phases of the compiler, i.e. Lexical analyzer, Syntax Analyzer, Semantic Analyzer, Intermediate Code Generation, Code optimization, Code Generation and finally generate a target program out of it. This language basically is used for hotel management and allows the programmer to perform certain operations like booking, bill generation and so on which are required in a hotel management system. We have restricted our language to 9 basic operations that the programmer can do.
Nine basic operations are as follow:
1. Add table
2. Add item
3. modify
4. Remove table
5. Remove item
6. bill
7. book
8. view
9. check

For generating the object code we will convert this language into a much simpler language SQL standard data access language for relational databases. SQL allows the data manipulation and query processing. We are trying to cover some part of SQL in our project considering the above mentioned operations.
